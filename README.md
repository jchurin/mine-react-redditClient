### Re-edit (a client for reddit)

Demo link: https://re-edit-client.herokuapp.com/

-------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Important Notes

* This project is still in progress, there are many things comming.
* I decided not to connect Reddit API per se, but connect to JSON data of Reddit API instead.  This way I got the same information than connecting API, but avoiding the process of key and token access.
* There are future improvements comming on this project. At the end of the day, I've just been working on it for five days.

### Future Improvements

* UI styling
* Null-checks on images for opening the gallery
* More content to Detail page
* UI-responsive improvements
* Restore data dismissed
* Spliting some redux sub-stores
* Spliting some components
